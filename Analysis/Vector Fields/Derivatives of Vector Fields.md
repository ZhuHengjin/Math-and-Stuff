## Del Operator

The $Del \ Operator$, denoted $\nabla$, can be viewed as both a differential operator and a vector it self. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the Del Operator is defined as

$$
\nabla = 
\left \langle 
{ 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, 
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}, 
\frac{\partial}{\partial z}
}
\right \rangle
$$

More generally, the Del operator in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is

$$
\nabla = 
\left \langle 
{ 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}, 
\cdots,
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}
}
\right \rangle
$$
